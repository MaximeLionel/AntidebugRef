* The heap contains *Two Flags (Flags & ForceFlags)* that are initialized in conjunction with the NtGlobalFlag;
* The *Two Flags (Flags & ForceFlags)* locations are different depends on the version of Windows:
    1. Flags:
        * - 0x40 in the heap on 32bit Windows Vista or later;
        * - 0x70 in the heap on 64bit Windows Vista or later;
        * Normally set to HEAP_GROWABLE (2);
        * *When a debugger is present*, on 64bit Windows, Flags is set to:
            ```
            HEAP_GROWABLE (2)
            HEAP_TAIL_CHECKING_ENABLED (0x20)
            HEAP_FREE_CHECKING_ENABLED (0x40)
            HEAP_VALIDATE_PARAMETERS_ENABLED (0x40000000)
            ```
    2. ForceFlags:
        * - 0x44 in the heap on 32bit Windows Vista or later;
        * - 0x74 in the heap on 64bit Windows Vista or later;
        * Normally set to 0;
        * *When a debugger is present*, on 64bit Windows, ForceFlags is set to:
            ```
            HEAP_TAIL_CHECKING_ENABLED (0x20)
            HEAP_FREE_CHECKING_ENABLED (0x40)
            HEAP_VALIDATE_PARAMETERS_ENABLED (0x40000000)
            ```
    * both of these values depend on the *subsystem version* of the host process for a *32-bit process*;
        * Subsystem Version >=3.51:     stated above;
        * Subsystem Version 3.10-3.50:  HEAP_CREATE_ALIGN_16 (0x1000) flag will also be set in both fields;
        * Subsystem Version < 3.10:     the file will not run;
* How it is set?
    * The HEAP_TAIL_CHECKING_ENABLED flag is set in the heap fields if the *FLG_HEAP_ENABLE_TAIL_CHECK* flag is set in the NtGlobalFlag field. 
    * The HEAP_FREE_CHECKING_ENABLED flag is set in the heap fields if the *FLG_HEAP_ENABLE_FREE_CHECK* flag is set in the NtGlobalFlag field. 
    * The HEAP_VALIDATE_PARAMETERS_ENABLED flag (and the HEAP_CREATE_ALIGN_16 (0x10000) flag on Windows NT and Windows 2000) is set in the heap fields if the *FLG_HEAP_VALIDATE_PARAMETERS* flag is set in the NtGlobalFlag field.
